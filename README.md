# Image-classification-using-deep-learning
This is our final year project of B.Tech.The project is actually about the image classification using deep convolutional neural netwoks.
we used cifar10 data set for classifying images.and we used Keras library of python.we maintained Jupyter Notebook as the coding platform.
